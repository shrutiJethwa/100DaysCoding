ðŸ“ŒExplanation:

You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
Return the shuffled string.

ðŸ“ŒExample:

Example 1:
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

Note:
1. You can create an auxiliary string t of length n.
2. Assign t[indexes[i]] to s[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.
