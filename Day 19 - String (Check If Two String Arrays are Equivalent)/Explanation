Explanation:

Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.
A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.
 
ðŸ“Œ Example:

Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.

Example 2:
Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: word1 = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
Output: true

ðŸ“Œ Note:
1. Concatenate all strings in the first array into a single string in the given order, the same for the second array.

2. Both arrays represent the same string if and only if the generated strings are the same.
