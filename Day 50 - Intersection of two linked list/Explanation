ğŸ“ŒExplanation:

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. 
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

ğŸ“ŒHow we are going to do that:

1. we are going to use two pointers, one pointer which is going to move just one step at a time, second is a pointer which is going to move two steps at a time.

2. If there is a cycle present in LinkedList then these pointers are going to meet at a point otherwise 
the other pointer will be null when the first pointer is in the mid of LinkedList.

ğŸ“ŒTest Cases:

ğŸ“ŒTest Case 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

ğŸ“ŒTest Case 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

ğŸ“ŒTest Case 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list
