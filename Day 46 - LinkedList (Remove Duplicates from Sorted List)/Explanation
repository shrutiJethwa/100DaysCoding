ğŸ“ŒProblem Statement: Linked List (Merge Two Sorted Lists)


ğŸ”—Explanation:
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

ğŸ”—Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

ğŸ”—Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

ğŸ”—Constraints:
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
