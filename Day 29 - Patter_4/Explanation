ðŸ“ŒPrint Pattern:

ðŸ“ŒExplanation:
In the above pattern the row is denoted by i and the column is denoted by j.
We see that the first row prints only a star. The second-row prints two star, and so on.
Here we have to use two for loops, the first for loop is for row and the second for loop for columns.
The first print statement prints a star at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
Now the value of i and j is incremented with each iteration.
For n=5 (the number of rows we want to print).

Iteration 1:
For i=0, 0<5 (true)
For j=0, j<=0 (true)
The first print statement prints a star at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
*
Now the value of i and j is increased to 1.

Iteration 2:
For i=1, 1<5 (true)
For j=1, 1<=1 (true)
The first print statement prints two stars at the second row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
*
* *
Now the value of i and j is increased to 2.

Iteration 3:
For i=2, 2<5(true)
For j=2, 2<=2 (true)
The first print statement prints three stars at the third row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
*
* *
* * *
Now the value of i and j is increased to 3.

Iteration 4:
For i=3, 3<5 (true)
For j=3, 3<=3 (true)
The first print statement prints four stars at the fourth row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
Now the value of i and j is increased to 4.

Iteration 5:
For i=4, 4<5 (true)
For j=4, 4<=4 (true)
The first print statement prints four stars at the fourth row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
For i=5, 5<5 (false)
The execution of the program will terminate when the value of i will be equal to the number of rows.
Now this logic needs to be reversed to print the rest pattern in reverse order.
Here again initiate two for loops but decrementing the value of i and j will print * in reverse.
