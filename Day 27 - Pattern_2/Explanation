ðŸ“ŒPrint Pattern:
*****
****
***
**
*

Explanation:
In the above pattern the row is denoted by i and the column is denoted by j. We see that the first row prints only a star.

The second-row prints two star, and so on.

Here we have to use two for loops, the first for lopp is for row and the second for loop for columns.
The first print statement prints a star at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
Use the outer for loop to iterate through rows from n to 1.where n is number of rows.
Use the inner for loop to iterate through columns from 0 to i.
Print the pattern where the condition satisfies.
Display the result.
