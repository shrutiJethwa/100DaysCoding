*Topic learned: Finding Pivot index of an array.
Explanation: Pivot index is defined as an index whose sum of the numbers to the left is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right.

You have given an array of integers. Write a program to return the pivot index of the given input array if no such index exists, then return -1. If there are multiple pivot indexes, then return the left-most pivot index.

Question:https:https://lnkd.in/djyfmzKz

Lets say we have an array nums.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
