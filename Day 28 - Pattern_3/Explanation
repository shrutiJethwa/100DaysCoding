Print Pattern:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

ðŸ“ŒExplanation:

In the above pattern the row is denoted by i and the column is denoted by j.
We see that the first row prints only a number. The second-row prints two numbers, and so on.
Here we have to use two for loops, the first for lopp is for row and the second for loop for columns.
The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
Now the value of i and j is incremented with each iteration.

For n=5 (the number of rows we want to print).
Iteration 1:
For i=1, 1<=5 (true)
For j=1, j<=i(1) (true)
The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
1
Now the value of i and j is increased to 2.


Iteration 2:
For i=2, 2<=5 (true)
For j=2, 2<=2 (true)
The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
1
1 2
Now the value of i and j is increased to 3.


Iteration 3:
For i=3, 3<=5 (true)
For j=3, 3<=3 (true)
The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
1
1 2
1 2 3
Now the value of i and j is increased to 4.


Iteration 4:
For i=4, 4<=5 (true)
For j=4, 4<=4 (true)
The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
Now the value of i and j is increased to 5.


Iteration 5:
For i=5, 5<=5 (true)
For j=5, 5<=5 (true)
The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
Now the value of i and j is increased to 6.


For i=6, 6<5 (false)
The execution of the program will terminate when the value of i will be greater to the number of rows.
