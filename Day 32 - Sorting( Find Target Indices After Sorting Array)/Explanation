📌Explanation
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.
A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.
Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. If there are no target indices, return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.

📌Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
    The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
    
📌Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 3
    Output: [3]
    Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
    The index where nums[i] == 3 is 3.


📌Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 5
    Output: [4]
    Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
    The index where nums[i] == 5 is 4.
 

📌Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    1 <= nums[i], target <= 100
