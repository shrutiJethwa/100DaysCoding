ðŸ“ŒExplanation:
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
 
ðŸ“ŒExample 1:
Input: s = [3,5,4,8,9]
Output: [3,4,5,8,9]


ðŸ“ŒExample 2:
Input: s = [10,5,8,9,7,6,3]
Output: [3,5,6,7,8,9,10]
