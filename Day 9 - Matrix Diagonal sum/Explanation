 Topic learned: Diagonal Sum of a Matrix

◾Explanation: Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.
Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.
 
◾Test Cases:
1) If a matrix is empty
2) If matrix is not a square matrix
3) User input a string instead of number.

◾Example
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
